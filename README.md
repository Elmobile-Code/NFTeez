# Features to be added (currently WIP)
- A more comprehensive list of NFTs to pull from, currently had to use reverse engineered data since there is no public API
- Integration to buy/sell NFTs instantly either listing at floor or buying floor price

# Future Ideas
- Be able to search for an NFT based on image traits ('show me an NFT available for sale that has a green background and features a penguin')
  - This will require us to index most NFT collections and run analysis on the metadata images
